# Intel-8080-Emulator
A general purpose Intel 8080 Emulator. This emulator will not be cycle accurate, although I do plan to incorporate accurate cycle counting.

# Future Plans

- Cycle counting
- General Purpose Bus for the following purposes:
  + Allow for easy incorporation of other emulated devices
  + Allow for easy output capture
  + Provide a general purpose API to the CPU
-Following the BUS' purpose, allow interfacing between the c8080 and the terminal(cout, cin)
